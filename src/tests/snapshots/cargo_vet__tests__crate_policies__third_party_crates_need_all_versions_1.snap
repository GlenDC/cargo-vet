  × There are some issues with your third-party policy entries

Error:   × some crates have policies that are missing an associated version
  │   third-party:2.0.0
  help: Specifing `dependency-criteria` requires explicit policies for each
        version of a crate. Add a `policy."<crate>:<version>"` entry for
